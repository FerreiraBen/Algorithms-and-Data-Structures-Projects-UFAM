# AVL-Tree
CONCEPT
An AVL Tree is a balanced search binary tree, that is, they are trees that minimize the number of comparisons made in the
worst case for a search with keys of probabilities of identical occurrences.
However, in order to guarantee this property in dynamic applications, it is necessary to reconstruct the tree to its ideal state at each operation on its nodes, in order to achieve an algorithm cost with the search time tending to O (log n).

GOAL
Solve the problem proposed in the classroom, applying the AVL Tree and its resources to minimize search space.

PROBLEM
Considering what was discussed in the classroom, about the scheduling service of a hypothetical psychology clinic, where we will have a collaborative service.
A program should be built to schedule therapeutic sessions, using AVL trees to register these appointments.
